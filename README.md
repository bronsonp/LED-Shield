This device consists of 32 individually controllable LEDs, two analog joysticks, and four switches. It can be controlled from an Arduino Uno or a NXP FRDM development board.

## Assembly instructions

If you received a board with the LEDs and other surface mount components already soldered, then please refer to the [through-hole assembly instructions](Documentation/Through-Hole-Assembly.md).

## Software instructions 

If you are using an Arduino to control the shield, there is a pre-made driver library and some example applications. Refer to the [Arduino software instructions](Documentation/Arduino-Library.md) for more information.

## Technical documentation 

For technical details, refer to the [electrical schematic](Documentation/Schematic.pdf) for the circuit.
