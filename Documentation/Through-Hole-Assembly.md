# Assembly instructions (for through-hole components)

If you received a board with the LEDs and other surface mount components already soldered, you must solder the following components:

 * 10 kΩ resistors at R1 and R2.
 * 2.4 kΩ resistors at R3 and R4.
 * 100 μF capacitor at C1. Be careful not to put the component in backwards! These capacitors have a negative terminal marked with minus signs on a vertical stripe. Put the negative sign away from the "+" marked on the circuit board. If in doubt, ask your tutor!
 * 2 x joysticks. You may need to carefully bend the pins to make them line up with the holes on the circuit board.
 * Headers along the edges of the board. Hint: you can use an Arduino to hold the headers in place to keep them straight while you solder.
